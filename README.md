Hello, I'm a mechanical engineer graduated from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, passionate about programming. Currently, I'm studying at Trybe, a programming school, and working as a senior business analyst.

I have previous experience as a production planning and control analyst, where I gained valuable skills in process analysis and optimization. My engineering background has provided me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and logical thinking, which I apply to my programming projects.

I have been dedicating my free time to developing small projects, using various programming languages and technologies such as C++, JavaScript, Python, CSS, and HTML. These experiences allow me to put my knowledge into practice and explore my interest in programming in a creative way.

I'm constantly seeking learning and growth opportunities. Currently, I'm focused on expanding my programming knowledge, honing my skills, and working on challenging projects. My goal is to find opportunities that allow me to apply my technical skills and passion for programming to create innovative solutions.

I'm open to connections and collaborations with other developers and programming enthusiasts. If you're looking for someone with knowledge in engineering and programming, feel free to reach out. Let's work together to achieve amazing results!
